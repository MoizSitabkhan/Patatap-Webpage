A Fun Cool Project using Howler and Paper Js

#### I made a Cool webpage just for Fun while learning about Paper and Howler Js

##### What this does that for any alphabet you press on the keyboard it will give a random animation of a Circle and a diffeent Sound for every key just gets you to keep playing with it !!

##### To get started just add all these files to a folder and just open the [Circles.html](https://www.google.com) file in a browser and enjoy !
